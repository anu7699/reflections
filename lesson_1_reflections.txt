This lesson helped me understand how important it is to keep different versions of 
a file saved in case we need to undo some unnecessary changes.
It also becomes highly convenient for us to if we have system capable of comparing
 different versions of file and indicate specifically, the places where changes have  been made.

Having access to the entire history of a file makes us more efficient programmer
in the long run because we have complete record of the the changes made which helps 
us learn from our previous mistakes and also to keep a track of the bigger path we have to traverse while 
paying attention to the intricacies.

SAVING MANUALLY
pros:
it permits us to commit logical changes.
provides more flexibility
makes commit history more meaningfful
cons:
there is a fair possibility of human error.
if user forgets to save the changes he made, all the changes are lost.

git log command gives us the entire history of commits made along with their unique id and message

git diff commit_id_prev commit_id_current
above command tells us where have the insertions and deletions been made.
