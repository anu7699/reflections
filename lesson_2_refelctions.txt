when we create a git repository, .git folder containing the meta data and other info is created. 
this is what differentiates a git repository from a normal repository.

staging area is an intermediate place that stores the files to be added in the next commit
thsi is useful when we have to add more than one files to our commit at a time so
we push both of them in the staging area first rather than passing them one by one directly
